# Practical React with Typescript - Snorre Edition

The `main` branch contains the starter code you can clone to begin working with the respository. You can find the code we built together throughout the course in a separate `course/*` sub branch named the date of the first course day.

## Getting started

Before you begin there are a few prerequisites you should have installed and set up:

- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (preferrably the latest LTS version)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com) for your OS
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSCode), you can use any IDE you prefer, but this project comes with settings specifically for Visual Studio Code.
- Create a Github account if you do not already have one.

Clone the code from the repository here: https://github.com/rudfoss/practical-react-with-typescript.git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudfoss/practical-react-with-typescript.git
```

Install all dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Open VSCode in the root folder and install recommended extensions. You can use a new profile in VSCode if you don't want to alter your existing extensions. There is also a profile included with this repository here: `.vscode\practical-react.code-profile`
